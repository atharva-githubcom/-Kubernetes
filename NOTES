NOTES FOR KUBERNETES.

1. What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source platform that helps in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications automatically. It ensures that applications run smoothly without manual intervention, even if some parts fail.

2. What is a Pod?
A Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. It contains one or more containers that share storage, network, and configurations. If a Pod fails, Kubernetes replaces it automatically.

3. What is Deployment?
A Deployment manages a group of Pods. It helps in creating, updating, and scaling applications automatically. If something goes wrong, it allows easy rollback to a previous version.

4. What is Rollout?
A Rollout is the process of updating a Deployment. Kubernetes gradually replaces old Pods with new ones to prevent downtime. If an update fails, you can roll back to the previous version.

5. What is Replication Controller?
A Replication Controller ensures a fixed number of Pods are always running. If a Pod crashes, it creates a new one. However, it is deprecated and replaced by ReplicaSet.

6. What is ReplicaSet?
A ReplicaSet is an improved version of Replication Controller. It ensures the desired number of Pods are running and supports more flexible Pod selection. Deployments use ReplicaSets internally.

Difference Between Replication Controller and ReplicaSet in Kubernetes
1. Replication Controller (Old)
Replication Controller ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. If a Pod crashes or is deleted, the Replication Controller automatically creates a new one to maintain the desired state. However, it only supports equality-based selectors (e.g., key=value), which limits its flexibility.

2. ReplicaSet (New & Recommended)
ReplicaSet is the improved version of Replication Controller. It provides the same functionality but supports both equality-based and set-based selectors (matchLabels, matchExpressions). This allows for more advanced selection and filtering of Pods.

3. What Should You Use Today?
Instead of using ReplicaSet directly, it is best to use Deployments, which internally use ReplicaSets to manage Pods. Deployments provide automatic rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.
