## üîê What is Authorization in Kubernetes?

**Authorization** is about **what you‚Äôre allowed to do** in the Kubernetes cluster ‚Äî after your identity is confirmed.

---

### üß† Simple Analogy:

Imagine you‚Äôve shown your ID (Authentication ‚úÖ)  
Now the guard checks your **permissions**:

> ‚ÄúOkay, you're John. Are you allowed to enter the control room?‚Äù

That‚Äôs **Authorization**.

---

## ‚úÖ Example

- You run:  
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
  ```

- Kubernetes checks:
  - Are you authenticated? (Who are you?)
  - Are you **authorized** to delete pods in this namespace?

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Authorization in Kubernetes

| Method             | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **RBAC** (most used) | Role-Based Access Control ‚Äî define who can do what     |
| ABAC               | Attribute-Based Access Control (less common)             |
| Webhook            | External systems decide authorization                    |
| Node Authorization | For kubelet nodes only                                   |

## üîß RBAC ‚Äì Role-Based Access Control

This is the most popular method.

You create:

### 1. **Role** or **ClusterRole**  
Defines **what actions** are allowed.

```yaml
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

---

### 2. **RoleBinding** or **ClusterRoleBinding**  
Links a user/service account to the Role.

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

This means:  
üîê `dev-user` can **get and list pods** in the `default` namespace.

---

## üîç How to Check What You Can Do

```bash
kubectl auth can-i delete pods --namespace=default
```

Output:
```
yes
```
or
```
no
```
